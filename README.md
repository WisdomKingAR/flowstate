## 🏆 Built at Cyber Cypher — NMIMS National Hackathon 2025

FlowState was designed and built during **Cyber Cypher**, an 18-hour national hackathon hosted by NMIMS Mumbai. We qualified Round 1 and shipped this project under real time pressure — from problem framing to working demo in under 18 hours.

**Built by:**
- [Aaryan Raorane](https://github.com/WisdomKingAR) — UI/UX direction, product decisions, frontend implementation
- [Tejas Kute](https://github.com/tejaskute284-dotcom) — architecture, component structure, technical execution

## 📖 About

**FlowState** is a premium, intent-focused operating system concept designed to help professionals regain control over their focus. By unifying emails, meetings, and commitments into a single, visually stunning interface, FlowState eliminates the "tab-switching" tax and promotes continuous deep work.

## ✨ Premium Features

### 🧩 Intent-Focused Architecture
FlowState parses intent for maximum efficiency:
- **Action Required**: Priority emails that need your immediate decision are highlighted.
- **Thread Continuity**: A visual timeline that bridges the gap between email threads and calendar events.
- **Focus Mode**: A dedicated environment that blocks distractions and signals focus time to your team.

### 🎨 The "Premium Soft" Design System
A state-of-the-art visual system built for long-duration deep work:
- **Cinematic & Pearl Shadows**: Custom 4-layer shadow hierarchy (Ambient, Depth, Detail, Atmosphere) for physical depth.
- **Organic Curves**: Standardized **24px organic curves** (`rounded-3xl`) across the entire UI.
- **Glassmorphism Pro**: High-fidelity backdrop blurs and saturated overlays.
- **Ambient Lighting**: Subtle grain overlays and radial glows that respond to your theme.

### ⚡ Command Performance
- **Omni-Search Palette**: `⌘ + K` navigate anywhere or trigger actions instantly.
- **Physics-Based Motion**: Powered by **Framer Motion** and **Lenis** for high-end inertia scrolling.
